# 0.1.6

* Compatibility with changes in {crayon}.

# 0.1.5

* Small changes for backward compatibility with R. Verified working on 3.6.0.

# 0.1.3

* Enhanced version of `ipaint()` for interactively scrollable painted output. It no longer fills the terminal with junk. It's a nice terminal-only competitor to `View()`
